# Welcome to your AWS CDK Python project

This is a sample CDK app written in Python. It demonstrates a CDK stack that can be extended with AWS resources such as Amazon Glue, SNS, Lambda, Redshift, etc.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to run your app.

## Useful commands

* `python -m venv .venv`   create a virtual environment
* `source .venv/bin/activate` (or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows) activate your venv
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`   install project dependencies
* `cdk ls`        list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`     emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk diff`      compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk deploy`    deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk destroy`   remove this stack from your AWS account
